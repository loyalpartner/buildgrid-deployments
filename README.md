# BuildGrid deployment examples

This repository will contain examples of different approaches to deploying
[BuildGrid][0], ranging from a simple single-node Remote Execution service
to a scalable Kubernetes deployment.

Work is ongoing to add these deployment examples along with documentation
on running and interacting with them. There are some existing deployment
examples provided as docker-compose files in [the main BuildGrid repository][1].
