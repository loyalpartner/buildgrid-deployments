# Example LogStream-only BuildGrid deployment
#
#   Â¡FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT/DEMONSTRATION ONLY!
#
# This example provides a way to experiment with BuildGrid's LogStream
# service. It is intended to be used as a server-side counterpart for
# testing with the `bgd logstream` commands.
#
# This deployment provides:
#  - LogStream service on http://localhost:50051
#  - ByteStream service for the above LogStream, also on http://localhost:50051
#
# Basic usage:
#  - docker-compose -f logstream.yaml up
#  - docker-compose down
#
