This directory is used by BuildGrid's main Docker Compose manifest: it gets
bind mounted in worker bot containers and is included in PATH. Place here
static binaries of the external tools needed by the bots. Typical use case is
to copy here the `buildbox` binary used as a backend by the `buildbox` bot.
